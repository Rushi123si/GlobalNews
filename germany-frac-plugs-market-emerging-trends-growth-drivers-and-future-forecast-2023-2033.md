<h3><strong>What are Frac Plugs?</strong></h3>
<p>Frac plugs are specialized devices used in oil and gas well completions to provide temporary or permanent zonal isolation during hydraulic fracturing. They act as check valves, isolating specific sections of the wellbore to allow controlled stimulation and improved recovery of hydrocarbons. Available in materials like composite, dissolvable, and cast iron, frac plugs are critical for maximizing production from unconventional resources such as shale gas and tight oil.</p>
